This is an extension for Adobe Brackets http://brackets.io/,
which allows the live preview of AsciiDoc documents.

Most of the work and credits go to Glenn Ruehle for his 
Markdown preview extension (https://github.com/gruehle/MarkdownPreview),
which I ripped off and modified for AsciiDoc.

The actual formatting is performed by
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[Asciidoctor.js],
the Javascript incarnation of http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].

Other software used:

* http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/[Font Awesome 3.2.1] for font icons
* http://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js] for highlighting embedded source code

Now we need a syntax highlighter for AsciiDoc documents inside Brackets/CodeMirror...
