= AsciiDoc Live Preview for Adobe Brackets
Thomas Kern
:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

This is an extension for http://brackets.io[Adobe Brackets],
which allows for live preview of AsciiDoc documents.

IMPORTANT: Version 1.0.7 is using Asciidoctor 1.5.0 for rendering. This introduces
some small changes to the syntax. Please refer to http://asciidoctor.org/docs/migration/[Migrating to Asciidoctor 1.5.0]
for details.

Most of the work and credits go to Glenn Ruehle for his 
https://github.com/gruehle/MarkdownPreview[Markdown preview extension],
which I ripped off and modified for AsciiDoc.

The actual formatting is performed by
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[Asciidoctor.js],
the JavaScript incarnation of http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].

AsciiDoc mode for CodeMirror was created by 
Thaddee Tyl for https://github.com/espadrine/AsciiDocBox[AsciiDocBox], who
converted the highlighting mode from the Ace editor to CodeMirror.


Other software used:

* http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/[Font Awesome 4.1.0] for font icons
* http://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js] for highlighting embedded source code
* http://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax] is a JavaScript display engine for mathematics


== Installation

From the Brackets file menu, open the extension manager. Browse available extensions and install 'AsciiDoc Preview'.
This is the recommended way.

As an alternative, you may press the 'Install from URL...' button and
enter https://github.com/asciidoctor/brackets-asciidoc-preview[] into the input field.

After installation, an additional icon appears in the Brackets toolbar to the right. If the name of the file currently edited 
ends with one of the suffixes '.adoc', '.ad', '.asciidoc', or '.asc', pressing this icon displays the preview pane.

In the upper right corner of the preview pane, pressing the gear symbol opens the settings panel.

For better syntax highlighting of AsciiDoc, you may also want to install additional themes. I tried the 
https://github.com/MiguelCastillo[Themes] extension by Miguel Castillo. Themes do not all work equally
well for AsciiDoc, so you need to experiment. _Vibrant Ink_ is pretty colorful theme, for example.

== MathJax Support

Rendering of mathematical expressions is now supported by means of http://www.mathjax.org/[MathJax].
Unlike other components used by this plugin, MathJax is not included in the distribution,
but accessed via a CDN.

This means that you'll need a working internet connection in order to be able to see rendered expressions,
at least until MathJax was loaded and cached by Brackets for the first time.

The use of MathJax is disabled by default and must be switched on in the plugin's option panel (gear symbol in the preview pane)
by checking _Render math_. See http://asciidoctor.org/news/2014/08/12/asciidoctor-1-5-0-released/#spotlight-mathjax[Get technical with MathJax].

== Known Issues

* Preamble text directly following the title without an empty line in between is completely suppressed.
* In order to create
a TOC in your document, add attributes
+
----
:toc: 
:toc-placement: preamble
----
to the header of your document. Also make sure that your document
really has a preamble. Other values for +toc+ and +toc-placement+
attributes currently not supported.
